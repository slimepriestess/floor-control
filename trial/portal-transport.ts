/**
 * Portal transport — the two surfaces over the live relay.
 *
 * History note: this file originally carried two workarounds for relay
 * realities probed on 2026-08-11 (persona sends echoing back as webhook
 * users; `threadId` absent on all deliveries — portal#17/#18). Both were
 * fixed at the relay in portal PR #19, deployed 2026-08-17, and field-
 * canaried the same evening. What remains here is the post-#19 shape:
 *
 * 1. Self-filtering matches our own sent relay-message ids (primary) and
 *    our own personaId on delivered echoes (the relay now attributes owned
 *    webhook echoes as `kind:"persona"`, including through the send race).
 * 2. Surface classification is container-first: traffic in the control
 *    thread is control. The `!floor …` / `⟨floor⟩ …` prefix rule is kept
 *    as a HUMAN-TOLERANCE rule, not a relay workaround — a person typing
 *    `!floor join` in the room channel still reaches the arbiter. Traffic
 *    in unrelated threads under the room channel is not the room's.
 * 3. The `webhook:` name-keyed identity survives only as a last resort for
 *    authors the relay itself cannot attribute (foreign webhooks; personas
 *    with ambiguous displayNames, which the relay declines to guess). It
 *    keeps the collision-refusing fingerprint: the same derived id arriving
 *    with a different underlying shape is dropped and reported, never
 *    silently merged.
 *
 * Sends are hardened: one retry, then log-and-drop — a single RPC timeout
 * must never become an unhandled rejection that kills the arbiter (that is
 * exactly how the first live run died).
